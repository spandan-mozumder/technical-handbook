# Grafana

Dashboards, panels, alerts, and data sources

## Grafana

Grafana is a visualization platform for monitoring data. It connects to data sources (Prometheus, Loki, PostgreSQL, etc.) and displays metrics as beautiful, interactive dashboards.

## Key Concepts

- Dashboard — collection of panels displaying related metrics
- Panel — individual visualization (graph, gauge, table, heatmap, stat)
- Data Source — backend to query (Prometheus, InfluxDB, MySQL, Loki, Elasticsearch)
- Variables — template variables for dynamic dashboards ($namespace, $pod)
- Alerts — threshold-based notifications sent to contact points

## Common Dashboard Patterns

- RED Method (services): Rate, Errors, Duration — for request-driven services
- USE Method (resources): Utilization, Saturation, Errors — for infrastructure
- The Four Golden Signals (Google SRE): Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation
