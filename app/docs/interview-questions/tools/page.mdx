## From: Branching, Merge & Rebase

<QA question="Merge vs Rebase — when to use which?">

Merge: preserves complete history, safe for shared branches, creates merge commits. Rebase: creates linear history, cleaner git log, but rewrites commits. Rule: rebase local/feature branches, merge into shared branches. Never rebase commits that others have pulled.

</QA>

## From: Stash, Reset & Recovery

<QA question="Reset vs Revert — when to use which?">

Reset: rewrites history, use on local branches only. Revert: creates a new commit that undoes changes, safe for shared branches. Never reset commits that others have pulled — use revert instead.
