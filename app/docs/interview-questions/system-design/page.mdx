## From: Caching Strategies

<QA question="What is cache stampede and how to prevent it?">

Cache stampede (thundering herd) occurs when a popular cache key expires and hundreds of requests simultaneously hit the database. Solutions: 1) Lock/mutex — only one request fetches from DB, others wait, 2) Stale-while-revalidate — serve stale data while refreshing in background, 3) Probabilistic early expiration — some requests refresh before TTL.

</QA>

## From: CAP Theorem

<QA question="Is CAP theorem still relevant?">

Yes, but it's often misunderstood. In reality, partitions are rare, so the choice is more nuanced. PACELC theorem extends CAP: during Partitions choose AP or CP; Else (normal operation) choose Latency or Consistency. Systems like Spanner achieve near-global consistency using GPS/atomic clocks.
