# Frontend Interview Questions

import { QA } from "@/components/QA";

## HTML

<QA question="What does DOCTYPE do?">

`<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser to use HTML5 standards mode. Without it, browsers may use 'quirks mode' which emulates legacy behavior and can cause inconsistent rendering.

</QA>

<QA question="Difference between HTML and XHTML?">

XHTML is stricter — all tags must be closed, lowercase, and properly nested. HTML5 is more forgiving. XHTML uses XML syntax rules while HTML5 uses its own parser.

</QA>

<QA question="What is the DOM?">

The Document Object Model is a tree-like representation of HTML that JavaScript can manipulate. Each HTML element becomes a node in the tree. The browser builds this from the parsed HTML.

## CSS

<QA question="How does CSS specificity work?">

Specificity is calculated as (inline, IDs, classes/attributes/pseudo-classes, elements). Higher specificity wins. If equal, last defined rule wins. Example: #nav .link = (0,1,1,0) beats .nav .link = (0,0,2,0).

</QA>

<QA question="What is the difference between em, rem, px, and %?">

px = absolute pixels. em = relative to parent's font-size. rem = relative to root font-size (predictable). % = relative to parent's dimension. Use rem for typography, px for borders, % or viewport units for layouts.

## JavaScript

<QA question="What is a closure?">

A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has returned. This is how JavaScript implements data privacy and stateful functions.

</QA>

<QA question="Explain hoisting">

JavaScript moves declarations to the top of their scope during compilation. var declarations are initialized as undefined. let/const are hoisted but NOT initialized (temporal dead zone). Function declarations are fully hoisted; function expressions are NOT.

## TypeScript

<QA question="Interface vs Type — when to use which?">

Interfaces are best for object shapes and can be extended/merged. Types are more flexible — unions, intersections, primitives, tuples. Use interfaces for public APIs (extendable), types for everything else.

</QA>

<QA question="What is type narrowing?">

Type narrowing is when TypeScript reduces a union type to a more specific type based on control flow checks (typeof, instanceof, in operator, discriminated unions). It lets TS infer the correct type in each branch.

</QA>

<QA question="What is void in TypeScript?">

</QA>

## React

<QA question="Why do lists need a key prop?">

Keys help React identify which items changed, were added, or removed during re-renders. Without stable keys, React re-renders all items. Use unique IDs — never use array index as key if the list can be reordered.

</QA>

</QA>

## From: Animations & Transitions

<QA question="Why is transform better than top/left for animation?">

transform uses GPU compositing — it doesn't trigger layout or paint. Animating top/left triggers layout recalculation for every frame, causing jank. transform: translate() achieves the same visual effect at 60fps.

</QA>

## From: Box Model

<QA question="What is margin collapse and when does it happen?">

Adjacent vertical margins merge into one (the larger wins). It happens between: sibling elements, parent-child (if no border/padding), and empty elements. It does NOT happen with flexbox, grid, floats, or absolute positioning.

</QA>

## From: Layout — Flexbox & Grid

<QA question="When to use Flexbox vs Grid?">

Flexbox = one-dimensional (row OR column). Best for component layouts, navbars, card rows. Grid = two-dimensional (rows AND columns). Best for page layouts, complex grids, overlapping elements. Often used together.

</QA>

## From: Responsive Design

<QA question="Why mobile-first over desktop-first?">

Mobile-first means: (1) Start with essential content/styles, (2) Progressively enhance for larger screens, (3) Better performance on mobile (no unused desktop CSS loaded), (4) Forces content prioritization.

</QA>

## From: CSS Selectors

<QA question="What is the :has() selector?">

:has() is a 'parent selector' — it selects elements that contain matching children. Example: div:has(img) selects divs that contain images. It's a game-changer because CSS traditionally couldn't select parents based on children.

</QA>

## From: Accessibility (a11y)

<QA question="When should you use ARIA vs semantic HTML?">

Prefer semantic HTML — it has built-in accessibility. Use ARIA only when HTML alone can't express the interaction (custom widgets, SPAs, dynamic content). The first rule of ARIA: don't use ARIA if you can use a native HTML element.

</QA>

## From: HTML Forms

<QA question="Why is the label element important?">

Labels are critical for accessibility: (1) Screen readers announce what each field is for, (2) Clicking a label focuses/toggles its associated control, (3) It provides a larger click target on mobile.

</QA>

## From: Semantic HTML

<QA question="Why use semantic HTML over divs?">

Semantic HTML improves: (1) Accessibility — screen readers can navigate by landmarks, (2) SEO — search engines understand content structure, (3) Maintainability — code is self-documenting, (4) Default behaviors — forms submit, buttons are focusable.

</QA>

## From: Document Structure Tags

<QA question="What is the difference between defer and async on script tags?">

defer downloads in parallel and executes after HTML parsing in order. async downloads in parallel and executes immediately when ready (order not guaranteed). Use defer for scripts that depend on DOM; async for independent analytics/tracking scripts.

</QA>

<QA question="Why is the viewport meta tag important?">

Without it, mobile browsers render pages at desktop width (~980px) then scale down. The viewport meta tag tells browsers to use the device width, enabling responsive design.

</QA>

## From: Text & Media Elements

<QA question="Why use loading='lazy' on images?">

Lazy loading defers off-screen image downloads until the user scrolls near them. This improves initial page load time, reduces bandwidth, and improves Core Web Vitals (especially LCP for below-fold images).

</QA>

## From: Advanced JavaScript

<QA question="Difference between debounce and throttle?">

Debounce waits until activity stops (e.g., search input — fire after user stops typing). Throttle limits execution rate (e.g., scroll handler — fire at most once per 100ms). Debounce = 'wait then fire'. Throttle = 'fire at intervals'.

</QA>

## From: Asynchronous JavaScript

<QA question="Difference between Promise.all and Promise.allSettled?">

Promise.all rejects immediately if ANY promise rejects (fail-fast). Promise.allSettled waits for ALL to complete and returns results for each (fulfilled or rejected). Use allSettled when you need all results regardless of failures.

</QA>

## From: Event Loop

<QA question="Why do Promises execute before setTimeout(fn, 0)?">

Promises go into the microtask queue, setTimeout goes into the macrotask queue. After each macrotask, the event loop drains ALL microtasks before picking the next macrotask. So microtasks always have higher priority.

</QA>

## From: Advanced React

<QA question="What is reconciliation?">

Reconciliation is React's diffing algorithm that compares the new VDOM tree with the previous one. It uses heuristics: (1) Different element types = destroy and rebuild, (2) Same type = update attributes, (3) Keys help identify moved items in lists. This makes updates O(n) instead of O(n³).

</QA>

<QA question="When does a component re-render?">

A component re-renders when: (1) Its state changes, (2) Its parent re-renders (unless wrapped in memo), (3) Context it consumes changes. Props changing alone doesn't cause re-render — the parent re-rendering does.

</QA>

## From: React Hooks

<QA question="When to use useMemo vs useCallback?">

useMemo memoizes a computed value (e.g., filtered/sorted list). useCallback memoizes a function reference. Use useCallback when passing functions to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Both take a dependency array.
