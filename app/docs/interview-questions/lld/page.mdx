## OOPS

<QA question="What's the difference between a class and an object?">

A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior. An object is a concrete instance of that class with its own state. Think of a class like an architectural blueprint and an object like an actual building constructed from that blueprint. You can create multiple objects from a single class.

</QA>

<QA question="What is the 'this' keyword used for?">

The 'this' keyword refers to the current instance of the class. It's used to distinguish instance variables from local variables/parameters with the same name, to pass the current object as an argument, and to call other constructors (constructor chaining).

## From: Abstraction

<QA question="When to use abstract class vs interface?">

Use abstract class when: you want to share code (concrete methods) among closely related classes, you need non-public members, you need constructor logic. Use interface when: you want to specify a contract that unrelated classes can implement, you need multiple inheritance, you want loose coupling. In Java 8+, interfaces can have default methods, blurring the line.

</QA>

## From: Polymorphism

<QA question="What is the difference between overloading and overriding?">

Overloading (compile-time): Same method name, different parameter lists, in the same class. Resolved at compile time. Overriding (runtime): Same method signature in parent and child classes. Resolved at runtime based on actual object type. Overriding requires inheritance; overloading does not.
