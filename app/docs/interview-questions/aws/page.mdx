## From: IAM, Cognito & KMS

<QA question="What is the principle of least privilege?">

Grant only the minimum permissions required to perform a task. Start with zero permissions and add only what's needed. Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify unused permissions. Never use root account for daily operations.

</QA>

## From: RDS & DynamoDB

<QA question="RDS vs DynamoDB — when to use which?">

RDS: complex queries, JOINs, transactions, relationships, existing SQL applications. DynamoDB: simple access patterns, massive scale, sub-10ms latency, key-value/document data, serverless. DynamoDB requires careful key design upfront.

</QA>

## From: S3 & EBS

<QA question="S3 vs EBS vs EFS — when to use which?">

S3: object storage (files, images, backups, static sites). EBS: block storage attached to one EC2 (databases, OS). EFS: shared file system across multiple EC2 instances. S3 is cheapest, EBS is fastest, EFS is shared.

</QA>

## From: VPC, CloudFront & Route53

<QA question="Security Groups vs Network ACLs?">

Security Groups: instance-level firewall, stateful (return traffic auto-allowed), allow rules only. NACLs: subnet-level firewall, stateless (must allow return traffic explicitly), allow AND deny rules. Use SGs for instance control, NACLs for subnet-level defense in depth.
