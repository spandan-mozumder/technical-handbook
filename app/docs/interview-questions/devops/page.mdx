## Linux

<QA question="Difference between hard and soft links?">

</QA>

## From: Grafana

<QA question="RED vs USE method — when to use which?">

RED Method: for services/endpoints — how many requests, how many errors, how long they take. USE Method: for infrastructure resources (CPU, memory, disk, network) — how utilized, how saturated, any errors. Use both together for complete observability.

</QA>

## From: Prometheus

<QA question="Counter vs Gauge — when to use which?">

Counter: for things that only go up — requests served, errors occurred, bytes sent. Always use rate() to get useful per-second values. Gauge: for things that fluctuate — temperature, queue depth, active users. Can be used directly.
