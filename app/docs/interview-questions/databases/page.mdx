## From: Drizzle ORM

<QA question="Drizzle vs Prisma — key differences?">

Drizzle: TypeScript schemas, SQL-like API, thinner abstraction, smaller bundle, no code generation step. Prisma: custom schema language, higher-level API, auto-generated client, better for rapid prototyping. Drizzle is closer to SQL; Prisma is more ORM-like.

</QA>

## From: Aggregation Pipeline

<QA question="What is $unwind?">

$unwind deconstructs an array field — if a document has items: [A, B, C], $unwind creates 3 documents, each with one item. Essential before grouping on array elements.

</QA>

## From: Indexing & Schema Design

<QA question="When should you embed vs reference?">

Embed when: data is always accessed together, doesn't grow unboundedly, and you need atomic updates. Reference when: data is shared across documents, arrays grow large, or you need independent access. Rule of thumb: if you always need it together, embed it.

</QA>

## From: Prisma ORM

<QA question="Prisma vs raw SQL — when to use which?">

Prisma: type-safe queries, auto-completion, schema migrations, rapid development. Raw SQL: complex queries (CTEs, window functions), performance-critical operations, vendor-specific features. Prisma supports $queryRaw for escape hatches.
