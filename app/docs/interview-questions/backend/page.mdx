# Backend Interview Questions

## Node.js

<QA question="Why is Node.js single-threaded but still fast?">

Node delegates I/O operations (file reads, network requests, DNS) to libuv's thread pool (default 4 threads). The main thread never blocks — it registers callbacks and processes them when I/O completes. This is efficient for I/O-heavy workloads but NOT for CPU-heavy tasks.

<QA question="What is the output of the setTimeout JavaScript function?">

</QA>

## Express.js

<QA question="What happens if you forget next() in middleware?">

The request hangs indefinitely — the next middleware/handler never runs and the client gets no response (eventually times out). Always call next() to pass control, or send a response to end the cycle.

## From: Authentication & Security

<QA question="Where should you store JWT tokens on the client?">

HttpOnly cookies are safest — they can't be accessed by JavaScript (prevents XSS theft). Avoid localStorage (vulnerable to XSS). If using cookies, add SameSite=Strict and Secure flags. For SPAs, httpOnly cookies with CSRF tokens is the gold standard.

</QA>

## From: Clustering & Worker Threads

<QA question="Cluster vs Worker Threads — when to use which?">

Cluster: multiple processes, each with own memory, ideal for scaling HTTP servers across cores. Worker Threads: threads within one process, share memory via SharedArrayBuffer, ideal for CPU-intensive tasks (parsing, crypto, image processing) without blocking the event loop.

</QA>

## From: Streams & Buffers

<QA question="When should you use streams vs reading the whole file?">

Use streams for large files (>100MB), real-time data, or when you need backpressure control. Use fs.readFile for small files where simplicity matters. Streams use O(1) memory regardless of file size.
